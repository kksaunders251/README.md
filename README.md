# **Howdy, I'm Khayla Saunders** 🤠👩🏾‍💻  
## Welcome to my Git Crib! 
Feel free to call me Khai! I love to have sidebar chit-chats to make connections, have a laugh, and work hard. Integrity is important to me. One of my favorite quotes is from the GOAT Lebron "I know we're out the playoff race, but if I'm on the court, I'm going to play how I play, and I play to win. So, I **never will cheat the game**..."
## A few not so basic, basics
- I use she/her/hers pronouns
- 3x Gen Philadelphian! GO BIRDS! (Still learning football...BUT I frequent West Point games to support my little BIG cousin!)
- I can get a little southern, I went to undergrad at THE BEST HBCU, Tuskegee University
- I earned my Master's in  Historic Preservation from the University of Pennsylvania, where I enjoyed breaking traditional norms to save Black Philly Gems...check out my work with the [Tanner House](https://www.inquirer.com/arts/tanner-house-community-outreach-report-20240910.html)!
- I need my Mushroom Coffee Daily (Everyday Doze) 🍄
  
### Work Routine
I am at my best in the **mornings!** Ready to chit chat about work from 9-6pm
### Best Way to communicate 
- **Email**: For non-urgent but lengtheir questions because it helps me to process more efficiently and think through the problem better
- **Google Chat:** Casual quick questions/coonvos
- **In-person**: MY FAVORITE!
>  **ALSO** Feel Free to tap me, even if I have headphones on (I prefer to work with something in the background) 
### How do I like to give feedback? 
In person, but if it's easier to send you an email, I'm always taking notes that I can share
### How do I like to receive feedback? 
In-person is best, but if you don't have any time, email/Google chat is best. 
### My Goal for this year 
Continuous growth in my faith, become a software engineer, go on one international trip, and to keep learning so I can remain a person of service
