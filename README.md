### Work Hours 
I am at my best in the mornings! But I'll be available between 8 am and 7 pm 
### Best Way to communicate 
I prefer Google Chat over Email, but I love in-person communication best. 
Feel Free to tap me, even if I have headphones on (I prefer to work with something in the background) 
### How do I like to give feedback? 
In person, but if it's easier to send you an email, I'm always taking notes that I can share
### How do I like to receive feedback? 
In-person is best, but if you don't have any time, email/Google chat is best. 
### My Goal for this year 
Continuous growth in my faith, become a software engineer, go on one international trip, and to keep learning so I can remain a person of service
